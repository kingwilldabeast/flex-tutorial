## To add

**What else do I need?**
challenge mode, where outlines in a different z-plane are generated with random values, and you need to toggle the current ones to overlay then. need a target-container and five targets with outlines from randomly generated targetStyle. when the Enter button or submit button is clicked, if the target and box attributes match, it is correct!
fix spacing with y-axis and x-axis
fix color scheme shades of dark gray and neon orange, pink, green, yellow, blue
instructions to use arrow keys?
export the flex-direction details? copy to clipboard?
background color means selected, outline means currently targeted by arrows
flex-wrap? 
other align-items like baseline, for objects of diff height and width
