## To add

**What else do I need?**
have arrow keys up and down to toggle value options for each attribute
also have array of options for each attribute? i.e. directionOptions = ['row', 'column']
background color means selected, outline means currently targeted by arrows
flex-wrap? 
other align-items like baseline, for objects of diff height and width
have arrays of possible values instead of hard coding everything?
challenge mode, where outlines in a different z-plane are generated with random values, and you need to toggle the current ones to overlay then
