## To add

**What else do I need?**
header buttons to label
have buttons on left and sandbox on right?
x-axis and y-axis labels that switch AI vs JC based on row or column
have arrow keys toggle between buttons quickly? Would need some other indicator that the button was selected, to differentiate between the columns.
background color means selected, outline means currently targeted by arrows
flex-wrap? 
other align-items like baseline, for objects of diff height and width
have arrays of possible values instead of hard coding everything?
challenge mode, where outlines in a different z-plane are generated with random values, and you need to toggle the current ones to overlay then
